Generate Mapping File between UniProt Accession, Gene Name, and b number
Currently, this package only works for E coli strain K12.


Step 1: Download data from UniProt
[1] Go to "Escherichia coli (strain K12)" reference proteome at
    http://www.uniprot.org/proteomes/UP000000625
    In the "Download" tab, choose "Text" as Format, click "Go" to download
    a compressed file containing all UniProt annotations for E coli strain
    K12 proteins. You do NOT need to uncompress the file.
[2] Rename the downloaded file as "UP000000625.txt.gz".
    Put the files at current folder.

Step 2: Extract accession mapping
[3] Run the script "generate_bnumber_mapping.py" by:
   $ ./generate_bnumber_mapping.py UP000000625.txt.gz > UP000000625.tsv
    The "UP000000625.tsv" file is a tab-eliminated plain text file. Each
    line is one UniProt protein with four fields:
    (A) UniProt Accession
    (B) Gene Name
    (C) B Number
    (D) Protein Sequence
    If one UniProt protein has multiple accession numbers (or multiple
    gene names), they will be seperate by commas, and the first one is
    the primary accession. If one gene has b number listed by both 
    "OrderedLocusName" and "ORFNames", these b numbers are seperated by
    commans, and "OrderedLocusName" will be placed before "ORFNames",

Update 04/04/2018:
UniProt now provides E coli protein accession mapping at
    https://www.uniprot.org/docs/ecoli.txt
UniProt only curates protein coding genes, which renders the above two 
sources less useful if you are interested in non-protein-coding genes,
e.g. those coding for RNA. Alternatively, you can use
    http://www.ecogene.org/ecodownload/crossref
which is not limtied to protein coding genes. Similarly, EcoCyc also
provides mapping at
    https://ecocyc.org/gene-links.shtml
